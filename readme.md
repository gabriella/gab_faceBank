# Appropriating New Technologies

**Friday 9:30 am to 12:00 pm, Spring 2012**

**Office hours starting Wednesday at 1:30 pm**

## Course Description

What do you want your world to look like? This class will focus on creating the future by appropriating new technologies with openFrameworks. openFrameworks is a C++ toolkit designed by a global community of media artists, with an emphasis on real time interaction. Because it's C++, it provides an easy bridge to a huge variety of low level tools like OpenCV and FaceTracker -- which makes it easier to develop otherwise impossible projects, like the EyeWriter, or to explore cutting-edge ideas like real time face substitution. In this class, we'll work with technologies surrounding face tracking, eye tracking, 3d scanning, computer security, privacy, and sharing. We'll spend a lot of time understanding the intricacies of openFrameworks, with the goal of creating seamless, mind-blowing experiments, installations, and performance pieces that hijack new technologies to create the future we want to see. Prerequisites: A deep love for code, an intense passion for democratization of technology, and the ability to geek out when necessary. Or, at least, Introduction to Computational Media. This two-point course will meet in the first seven weeks of the semester.

## Mailing List and IRC

Outside class discussion will be held on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/appropriating-new-technologies/).

In class, we will keep a backchannel on IRC at `#appnewtech` on `irc.freenode.net`. If you don't have an IRC client, I recommend [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/), or using the [Freenode webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/).

## Schedule

This is just an overview. For more information about each week, including student-contributed information, see the [class wiki](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/AppropriatingNewTechnologies/wiki/). 

### [Week 1](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/AppropriatingNewTechnologies/wiki/Week-1): January 27

We'll look at a lot of examples of appropriation to get a feeling for how the class will go.

### [Week 2](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/AppropriatingNewTechnologies/wiki/Week-2): February 3

This week we're going to talk about faces: detection, recognition, and tracking.

### [Week 3](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/AppropriatingNewTechnologies/wiki/Week-3): February 10

All about 3d: scanning, interaction, visualization.

### Week 4: February 17

### Week 5: February 24

I will be away from class this week. Once it's closer, we can decide whether it makes more sense to reschedule or have someone else lead.

### Week 6: March 2

### Week 7: March 9

## Assignments and Grading

There will be assignments given at the end of the first four weeks, and a final project for the last two weeks.

In order to pass the class, students must complete the assignments, the final project, and attend class. A student will fail if they miss more than one class, miss more than one assignment, or fail to present a completed final project.

In order to receive feedback, the assignments must be handed in before the following class. Late assignments are completely acceptable, but they will not receive feedback.
